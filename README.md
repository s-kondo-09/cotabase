# Overview
This is a web application for sharing solutions to exercises from textbooks and reference books.

In science and engineering fields, textbooks often contain exercises without providing model solutions. This tendency is even more pronounced in older publications. However, many of these problems remain educational and worth solving today.

The concept of this website is to allow users to submit and share model solutions for future readers. By operating this website, we aim to provide benefits to authors, readers, and publishers.

The primary users are assumed to be physics students, but we plan to expand to other academic disciplines in the future.
